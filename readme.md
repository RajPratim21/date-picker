date-picker
============

A simple lightweight date-picker, with no external dependencies.

Current version
---------------

Currently, there are a number of dependencies. These are there to speed up
development, and will be extracted before going to 1.0.

- express: Express is used for serving the test-files, which includes a bit of
  server templating.
- hogan.js: hogan is used for templating, because it is easier and faster to
  experiment with raw html than with building dom-nodes.
