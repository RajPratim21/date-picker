GitHub Pages for the date-picker project. They can be seen at
[http://fizker.github.com/date-picker](http://fizker.github.com/date-picker).

They can be built with `npm install` or `node build-site.js`, but it requires
`perl` to be accessible on the path; There were no satisfactory node.js
implementation of `Markdown`, so the original `perl` version is included instead.
