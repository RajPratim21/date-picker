<p>There are a number of external functions on the DatePicker, that allows for
some measure of control.</p>

<p>When it comes to the look-and-feel, even more control can be achieved by
overriding the css.</p>

<h2>Exposed non-public methods</h2>

<p>There are more exposed methods than should be used normally; they are exposed
for testing purposes to allow unit tests to get into the system, and for extreme
flexibility, where a developer might want to override standard functions.</p>

<p>These methods will not be covered here, but can instead be found by <a href="https://github.com/fizker/date-picker/blob/master/src/dp.js">looking at
the code</a>.</p>

<h2>Exposed methods</h2>

<p>The methods that are exposed as public, and thus relatively stable, are described
below.</p>

<h3>Static methods</h3>

<p>The following methods are currently available directly on the constructor,
without requiring a new instance first.</p>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>formatDate(date, format)
    <td>Returns a string-version of the date based on the given format.
<tr>
    <td>parseDate(dateString, format)
    <td>Parses a string and returns a date based on the given format.
</table>

<p>They are called in the following fashion:</p>

<pre><code>var date = new Date()
DatePicker.formatDate(date, 'y-m-d');
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating the date-picker</h3>

<p>The constructor can take the following options:</p>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>elm
    <td>An element to bind to. This can be a real DOM element or a CSS selector
      pointing at an element.<br>
      It is an alternativ to passing the element through
      <code>#show([selector])</code> or <code>#toggle([selector])</code>.
<tr>
    <td>dateFormat
    <td>A format-string signifying how the code should interpret and print out
      dates in input-fields.<br>
      It supports the following keys (example date being 2012/05/07):
      <table class="ex-methods">
      <tr>
        <td>d
        <td>Day with leading zero (07)
      <tr>
        <td>D
        <td>Day without leading zero (7)
      <tr>
        <td>m
        <td>Month with leading zero (05)
      <tr>
        <td>M
        <td>Month without leading zero (5)
      <tr>
        <td>y
        <td>Year with 4 digits (2012)
      <tr>
        <td>Y
        <td>Year with 2 digits (12)
      </table>
      Any other characters will be printed as listed. It defaults to
      <code>y/m/d</code>.
<tr>
    <td>weekStart
    <td>A number signifying the first day of the week. It goes from <code>0</code>
      (sunday) to <code>6</code> (saturday) and defaults to <code>1</code>
      (monday). It corresponds to calling <code>Date#getDay()</code> on a
      javascript date object.
<tr>
    <td>weekdays
    <td>A list of localized day-names that should be shown above the day-cells.
      It should start with sunday on index 0, and end with saturday on index 6.
      It should not be much more than 2 letters of text, as that is approximately
      what there is room for. It defaults to <code>[ 'su', 'mo', 'tu', 'we',
      'th', 'fr', 'sa' ]</code>.
<tr>
    <td>months
    <td>A localized list of month names. It starts with January on index 0 and
      ends with December on index 11. It defaults to <code>[ 'Jan', 'Feb',
      'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov',
      'Dec' ]</code>.
<tr>
    <td>buttons
    <td>Localized texts for the three buttons in the UI (Next month, previous
      month, close). It defaults to <code>{ next: 'Next', prev: 'Prev', close:
      'Ã—' }</code>. Empty strings are perfectly acceptable, if CSS will be
      controlling the look (for example with background images).
<tr>
    <td>date
    <td>The date to initialize the date-picker with. It defaults to the current
      date, or if bound to an input-element, the parsed version of the
      input-value.
<tr>
    <td>floatingOverlay
    <td>A bool telling if the floating date picker should put an overlay behind
      that closes it when clicked. If <code>false</code> (the default), it will
      only close when a date is selected, the user clicks the close button, or
      <code>#hide()</code> or <code>#toggle()</code> is called via the API.<br>
      It is only applicable if the date picker is bound to an input-element, and
      thus floating.
</table>

<p>It is used in this fashion:</p>

<pre><code>var options =
    { dateFormat: 'y-m-d'
    , buttons: { next: '&amp;rarr;', prev: '&amp;larr;', close: 'X' }
    }
var dp = new DatePicker(options);
</code></pre>

<h3>Displaying</h3>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>show([selector])
    <td>Shows the date picker, and attaches it to the last given
    element. Alternatively, an element or css-selector can be supplied for the
    picker to attach to.
<tr>
    <td>hide()
    <td>Hides the date picker.
<tr>
    <td>toggle([selector])
    <td>Toggles between <code>show()</code> and <code>hide()</code> based on
      the current state. If the picker is currently showing, and
      <code>selector</code> refers to a different element, it will show at that
      new element instead of hiding.
<tr>
    <td>render()
    <td>Creates the picker with DOM nodes and returns a document-fragment
      with the contents. It will not be attached to anything by
      <code>render()</code>. Internally, this is done by <code>show()</code>.
</table>

<pre><code>&lt;input name=date&gt;
&lt;button onclick="dp.toggle('input[name=date]');"&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>The way to get information back out of the DatePicker, especially based on user
actions, is through events. It is possible to register and unregister events
using the <code>on()</code> and <code>off()</code> functions as shown below:</p>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>on(event, callback)
    <td>Adds a callback for an event. It throws if <code>callback</code> is not
      a function.
<tr>
    <td>off(event, callback)
    <td>Removes the specified callback for the named event.
<tr>
    <td>emit(event, [parameters, ..])
    <td>Sends the <code>event</code> to all listeners, passing the parameters
      as well.
<tr>
    <td>trigger(event, [parameters, ..])
    <td>Synonym for <code>emit()</code>
</table>

<p>The DatePicker currently emits the following events:</p>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>change
    <td>When a user selects a date. If the DatePicker is attached to an input,
      this will happen just after the input have been updated.
<tr>
    <td>show
    <td>Emitted after the date-picker appears, or is moved to a new container.
      This is bound to the <code>show()</code> function.
<tr>
    <td>hide
    <td>Emitted after the date-picker is hidden. This is bound to the
      <code>hide()</code> function.
</table>
