<p>There are a number of external functions on the DatePicker, that allows for
some measure of control.</p>

<p>When it comes to the look-and-feel, even more control can be achieved by
overriding the css.</p>

<h2>Exposed non-public methods</h2>

<p>First off, there are more exposed methods than should be used normally; they are
exposed for testing purposes to allow unit tests to get into the system, and for
extreme flexibility, where a developer might want to override standard functions.</p>

<p>I will not cover those here, and instead refer to the source code.</p>

<h2>Exposed methods</h2>

<p>Instead, the following methods are safe for use:</p>

<h3>Displaying</h3>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>show([selector])
    <td>Shows the date picker, and attaches it to the last given
    element. Alternatively, an element or css-selector can be supplied for the
    picker to attach to.
<tr>
    <td>hide()
    <td>Hides the date picker.
<tr>
    <td>toggle([selector])
    <td>Toggles between <code>show()</code> and <code>hide()</code> based on
      the current state. If the picker is currently showing, and
      <code>selector</code> refers to a different element, it will show at that
      new element instead of hiding.
<tr>
    <td>render()
    <td>Creates the picker with DOM nodes and returns a document-fragment
      with the contents. It will not be attached to anything by
      <code>render()</code>. Internally, this is done by <code>show()</code>.
</table>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>The way to get information back out of the DatePicker, especially based on user
actions, is through events. It is possible to register and unregister events
using the <code>on()</code> and <code>off()</code> functions as shown below:</p>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>on(event, callback)
    <td>Adds a callback for an event. It throws if <code>callback</code> is not
      a function.
<tr>
    <td>off(event, callback)
    <td>Removes the specified callback for the named event.
<tr>
    <td>emit(event, [parameters, ..])
    <td>Sends the <code>event</code> to all listeners, passing the parameters
      as well.
<tr>
    <td>trigger(event, [parameters, ..])
    <td>Synonym for <code>emit()</code>
</table>

<p>The DatePicker currently emits the following events:</p>

<table class="ex-methods">
<tr>
    <td>change
    <td>When a user selects a date. If the DatePicker is attached to an input,
      this will happen just after the input have been updated.
<tr>
    <td>show
    <td>Emitted after the date-picker appears, or is moved to a new container.
      This is bound to the <code>show()</code> function.
<tr>
    <td>hide
    <td>Emitted after the date-picker is hidden. This is bound to the
      <code>hide()</code> function.
</table>
